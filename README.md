* Configured to use TypeScript
  * `tsc -b -v -w -i`  runs without errors
  * `tsconfig.json` has been configured to have strict settings
* `eslint` **v8** is configured with airbnb (`eslint-config-airbnb-typescript`).
* Includes demo usage of `react-router-dom` **version 6**. Examples include:
  * Normal routes
  * Subroutes
  * 404 error handling
* Demonstates how to use [css modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) and includes an example of how to use `sass` in css.

* An example `.env` is already configured.
* npm scripts default exists and  commands for `eslint` has been added:
